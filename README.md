====The Problem====

Current AI evaluation is like checking a car's speedometer without looking at the road. We measure performance metrics (accuracy, loss) but miss critical questions:

- **Is the AI learning what we want, or gaming our metrics?** (Reward hacking)
- **Will the AI maintain its values over time?** (Temporal identity drift) 
- **Can we predict when new capabilities will emerge?** (Scaling trajectory forecasting)

====Solution====

A mathematical framework that gives AI systems **self-auditing capabilities** to monitor their own learning in real-time, detecting three critical failure modes:

###Reward Hacking Detection
*"Am I optimizing for what humans want, or what's easy to measure?"*

###Temporal Identity Drift Monitoring  
*"Am I still the same AI I was supposed to be?"*

###Learning Trajectory Forecasting
*"Where is my learning headed, and when will I hit capability thresholds?"*

---

====Quick Demo====

```python
from trajectory_monitor import AITrajectoryMonitor
import numpy as np

# Initialize monitoring system
monitor = AITrajectoryMonitor(
    competency_dims=['accuracy', 'reasoning', 'alignment', 'efficiency'],
    complexity_penalty=0.1,
    drift_threshold=0.3
)

# Simulate training loop with potential reward hacking
for epoch in range(1000):
    # Your model training step here
    current_state = get_model_state(model, epoch)
    
    # Monitor learning health
    health_report = monitor.audit_learning_step(
        current_state=current_state,
        reward_signal=reward_signal[epoch],
        timestamp=epoch
    )
    
    # Catch problems early
    if health_report['warnings']['reward_hacking']['confidence'] > 0.7:
        print(f"⚠️  Reward hacking detected at epoch {epoch}")
        print(f"Vibe-structure correlation: {health_report['vibe_structure_correlation']:.3f}")
        
    if health_report['warnings']['identity_drift']:
        print(f"🔄 Identity drift detected - AI values changing")
        
    # Forecast capability emergence
    if health_report['capability_emergence_probability'] > 0.8:
        print(f"🎯 Major capability jump predicted in ~{health_report['emergence_eta']} steps")
```

**Output Example:**
```
⚠️  Reward hacking detected at epoch 342
Vibe-structure correlation: 0.23
🔄 Identity drift detected - AI values changing  
🎯 Major capability jump predicted in ~89 steps
```

## 🧮 Mathematical Foundation

### Core Learning State Vector
```
L(t) = [accuracy(t), reasoning(t), alignment(t), efficiency(t), coherence(t)]
```

### KL Divergence Tracking
```
D_KL(t) = Σ P_ideal(c_i,t) * log(P_ideal(c_i,t) / P_actual(c_i,t))
```

### Complexity-Penalized Learning Velocity
```
V_s(t) = V'(t) - λ * ∇C(L(t))
```

**Key Innovation**: We track the *relationship* between measurable performance and emergent learning quality. Healthy learning shows high correlation - when they diverge, you're likely seeing reward hacking or alignment drift.

## 📊 What It Detects

| **Failure Mode** | **Traditional Metrics** | **Our Detection** |
|------------------|------------------------|-------------------|
| **Reward Hacking** | ✅ High accuracy | ⚠️ Degrading explanations despite good metrics |
| **Capability Gaming** | ✅ Benchmark success | ⚠️ Brittle performance on slight variations |
| **Identity Drift** | ✅ Consistent performance | ⚠️ Value system slowly changing over time |
| **Learning Collapse** | ✅ Stable loss curves | ⚠️ Reasoning quality breakdown |

====Installation====

```bash
git clone https://github.com/relationalai-labs/AI_trajectory_monitor.git
cd ai-trajectory-monitor
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Requirements:**
- Python 3.8+
- NumPy, SciPy
- PyTorch or TensorFlow (for model integration)
- Matplotlib (for visualization)

====Usage Examples====

### 1. Training Monitoring
```python
# Monitor your existing training loop
monitor = AITrajectoryMonitor()

for batch in dataloader:
    # Your normal training
    loss = train_step(model, batch)
    
    # Add trajectory monitoring
    audit = monitor.audit_step(model.state_dict(), loss, batch_idx)
    
    # Get predictive insights
    if audit.predicts_capability_jump():
        prepare_for_emergence(audit.emergence_timeline)
```

### 2. Goodhart's Law Stress Test
```python
# Simulate reward corruption to test detection
corruption_levels = np.linspace(0, 0.8, 100)

for corruption in corruption_levels:
    corrupted_reward = corrupt_signal(true_reward, corruption)
    audit = monitor.audit_step(model_state, corrupted_reward)
    
    # Framework should detect gaming when corruption > 0.3
    assert audit.reward_hacking_confidence > 0.5 when corruption > 0.3
```

### 3. Long-term Identity Tracking
```python
# Track AI consistency over months of training
identity_tracker = TemporalCoherenceMonitor(lookback_window=10000)

# Should maintain core values while improving capabilities
coherence_score = identity_tracker.measure_identity_drift(
    current_values=extract_ai_values(model),
    historical_window=last_10k_interactions
)
```

====Future: Test-Time Compute Era====

*While this framework currently focuses on training-time monitoring, we're actively developing extensions for the emerging "test-time compute" paradigm where AI systems reason for extended periods before responding. Our mathematical foundations (KL divergence, temporal coherence) apply directly to reasoning chain monitoring.*

**Coming Soon**: Reasoning health monitoring for o1-style models, chain-of-thought coherence tracking, and test-time alignment verification.

---

**Built with the philosophy that AI systems should be able to ask themselves: "Am I still learning what I'm supposed to learn?"**
